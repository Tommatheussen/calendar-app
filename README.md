# calendar-app
This app allows my girlfriend to enter her working shifts in the form of a calendar.
After saving the data will be synced with Google Calendar so it cna be viewed from anywhere.

Running here: https://tommatheussen.github.io/calendar-app

Later improvements:
  - Clear previous events (to remove stuff from google calendar since it's no longer usefull)
  - Management
      - Select calendar to perform actions against
      - Edit shifts
      - Add/remove shifts
  - Coworkers
  - Proper cross-browser and performance?
